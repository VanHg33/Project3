This may require an ensemble of approaches, for example statistical sampling, manual and automated approaches to validation.\n• Managing internal validation processes before outputs are sent to project partners.\n• Working closely with the data science team to provide feedback for the mapping model development.\n• Analysing complex model outputs, to derive valuable insights for reporting to project partners, including visualisation techniques.\n• Providing advice to technical services on interface design for a validation application for project partners.\n\nRequired experience/skills:\n• Demonstrated experience in data analysis and process design, to create replicable data validation processes to improve data output quality.\n• Excellent analytical skills, with strong attention to detail, and the ability to synthesise and critically analyse large volumes of structured and unstructured data.\n• Strong skills and experience in data management, in particular how data can be effectively structured, analysed, presented and communicated, to achieve high-quality outcomes.\n• Excellent communication skills, including the ability to effectively communicate key data insights visually and in written form to a range of diverse stakeholders\n• Well-developed interpersonal skills, including the ability to work effectively in a multidisciplinary setting.\n\nDesirable experience skills:\n• Experience in R Shiny, Python, SQL, anduser experience design.\n• Understanding of, and experience working with tertiary education (HE and/or VET) and/or occupation and labour market data.\n• Understanding and experience in data science, or related fields.\n• Experience operating in a policy environment.\n\nIf this sounds like the role for you, and you'd like to learn more, click apply now. f2f Recruitment team will be happy to assist you.\n\nLisa Whitehorn\n\n02 6199 5750\n\nTeamICT@f2frecruitment.com.au\n\nExcited about this role but don’t believe your experience perfectly matches all job specifications?

        "job_description": "Data Scientist - Physical Modelling will collaborate across many stakeholders to analyze and refine datasets that will shape subsurface models\nAbout Fleet Space Technologies\nFleet is a space-enabled exploration technology company on a mission to dramatically accelerate the discovery of critical minerals needed to decarbonize our global economy. Electric vehicles and other clean energy technologies are vital elements of the world’s efforts to combat climate change, and these will demand many times more critical minerals than today, with an incremental value of over USD $13 trillion. At the same time, finding new mineral deposits is becoming more challenging as we increasingly exhaust the supply of shallow deposits and are forced to explore deeper underground. Traditional exploration methods are poorly suited to address this challenge, so a new approach is needed.\n\nOur approach is to combine space technology, proprietary seismic sensors, cutting edge Ambient Noise Tomography, and machine learning to provide the world’s first scalable 3D exploration dataset with near-real-time insights to guide active exploration programs far more efficiently to new deposits. This is Fleet’s flagship product, ExoSphere - a space-enabled solution for mineral exploration in real-time, in 3D, and under cover with very low environmental impact. Since launching ExoSphere in March 2022, Fleet has signed contracts with over 30 clients including Rio Tinto, Barrick Gold and Core Lithium and completed over 120 Ambient Noise Tomography surveys, more than any other company in the world.\n\nAs part of Fleet’s founding vision to connect the Earth, Moon, and Mars, we also apply our technology to innovative solutions for defense and space exploration, including an upcoming mission to the Moon. Headquartered in Adelaide, South Australia, Fleet has rapidly grown to over 100 employees including a growing team in the USA, Canada, and beyond. We have raised over AUD $85M in venture funding, backed by premier investors including Blackbird, Grok, and In-Q-Tel.\n\nCore Values\nThe Core Values at Fleet Space Technologies guide us to our North Star of ambitious, collaborative success - AD ASTRA (“To the Stars!”)\n• Add Value: Obsessively add value for our customers\n• Drive Excellence: Benchmark against the best\n• Agile Action: Take Action. Independent, fast, frugal action\n• Seek Truth: Be curious. Explore\n• Take Responsibility: Make decisions and own them\n• Radical Ideas: We are unique. We do things differently\n• Always Deliver: We always find a way to get it done on time\n\nThe Team\nThe Science Team at Fleet Space Technologies is composed of team-oriented technical experts who are driving innovation in exploration technology for use on the Earth and beyond it. As the core developers of ExoSphere, we are at the forefront of several fields all at once – seismology, exploration geology, and machine learning to name a few. We are creative, combining space technology and in-house sensors with computational geophysics and machine learning to unlock geological insight from the subsurface in a way that nobody else has tried before. And we are bold, applying this technology not just on the Earth, but on the surface of other planetary bodies in our solar system. It's not rocket science, but it's close! One must not only bring proven technical expertise, but also be open minded, agile, and adaptable to solve challenges that could very well change our world (and others beyond). We value diversity of perspective, journey, industry experience, skillset, working style, communication preference, and identity; the fact that we come from over 28 nationalities only reinforces our commitment to Inclusion & Diversity.\n\nAs a business, we are ambitious, innovative, and collaborative and we put our customers first in everything that we do. We love celebrating our successes, and we have had a lot to celebrate to date including Series C Funding and selection of our technology to be among the first Australian hardware to be deployed on the Moon. We are a diverse group of professionals who have come together for one purpose - to build spacecraft for explorers of new worlds with a mission to connect Earth, Moon and Mars. Come help shape the future through this fantastic opportunity!\n\nThe Role\nFleet Space Technologies is seeking a highly skilled Data Scientist to join the Science team and guide the Physical Modelling activities across cross-functional teams.
