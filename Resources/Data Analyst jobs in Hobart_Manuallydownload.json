        "job_description": "Who are we?\nUpGuard’s mission is to protect the world’s data. We obsessively seek out elegant, robust ways to enable our customers to find, acknowledge, and remediate cyber risks. With UpGuard, organisations leverage our security expertise and software to automate what were once laborious, spreadsheet-driven processes–monitoring the attack surface of hundreds of vendors or assessing the security of their own infrastructure. UpGuard is used by some of the world’s largest, fastest growing and most innovative companies.\n\nWhy are we hiring for this role?\nAs UpGuard continues to scale at an increasing rate, each of our teams, from Product to Sales, is becoming more data and insight hungry. As a result, our central Analytics and BI function is bandwidth constrained and needs to scale with our business growth.\n\nAs a Senior Business Analyst, you will be responsible for ensuring that all teams not only have access to the data they need but also provide powerful insights that can help UpGuard scale and make important decisions. You will be able to use your understanding of business structure and processes to understand stakeholder needs and provide them with the correct information and insights in the most useful and concise format.\n\nWe are looking for someone with 4+ years of experience working in both Analytics and Business Operations roles. Candidates should have a Bachelor's Degree in a Mathematical, IT, Science or Engineering field. As our team is currently small, we're looking for someone who is self-sufficient.\nWhat you will accomplish\n• Understand the business data needs of various teams within the organisation, from stakeholders that do and do not have a technical background. A successful candidate will not only be able to digest requirements but also converse with stakeholders in a constructive and comfortable manner, as you are providing “customer support” to other teams.\n• Be able to transform raw data into useful insights through the use of our Business Intelligence platform and present information in a way that conveys powerful and pertinent insights for stakeholders. Our BI platform is Looker, so we are looking for candidates who are familiar with both the Explore/Look/Dashboard side of Looker as well as have experience with the Developer side of Looker.\n• Be able to learn and understand our business processes, from our sales pipeline structure to our product usage metrics.\n• Be able to undertake projects around trend analysis, seasonality and other more complex mathematical analyses on behalf of stakeholders.\n• Be able to not only suggest areas of improvement for our processes, teams and infrastructure but also be able to plan, implement and test the proposed solution.\nWhat would give you an edge? We have a Google Platform-based BI-stack. These are the technologies and skill sets we are looking for:\n• Looker is our main BI platform: a candidate should be familiar with Explores, Looks, Dashboards and the Developer interface - maintaining dimensions and measures, creating and maintaining models, and being able to run and debug raw SQL queries.\n• Google Sheets when we need to explore data in more detail: you should be comfortable with functions like pivot tables, vlookup, and charting.\n• CloudSQL (PostgreSQL) and BigQuery for storage and query: be comfortable with writing complex queries.\n• Experience with broader data sourcing and storage platforms such as Google Analytics, and Sales CRMs, and how they interact and connect with one another.\nWhat's in it for you?\n• Rapidly growing user base: Work directly with some of the world’s largest, fastest-growing, and most innovative companies\n• Interesting problems, at scale: Deeply explore the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, with a platform processing billions of data points daily\n• Learn from industry-leading experts: Our security research has been featured in The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, TechCrunch, Bloomberg, Gizmodo, Engadget, Forbes, ZDNet, and The Guardian\n• Impact: See the impact of your work on a daily basis, with data and impact available on dashboards you have access to\n• Generous compensation: Competetive salary & stock options.\n• Great perks: Grocery and gym reimbursements, flexible work arrangements, learning and development stipend, and generous PTO package\nMy Startup Gig ran an independent review into life at UpGuard. To see what it's like to work at UpGuard, check out their survey results here.\n\nBefore starting work with us, you will need to undertake a national police history check and reference checks. Also please note that at this time, we cannot support candidates requiring visa sponsorship or relocation.\n\nUpGuard is an Equal Opportunity Employer and qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender perception or identity, national origin, age, marital status, protected veteran status, or disability status.",

Our customers use us to better understand their people and their job candidates. We are like the ‘Moneyball’ of hiring, helping businesses focus on the things that matter and removing those that don’t. The result? A fairer, cheaper, faster and more accurate hiring process that focuses on the skills needed for the job. Our vision is to create a world where everyone can get the job they deserve. Can you help us achieve that?\n\nOur culture is very important to us. We value no-nonsense people who use common sense to get sh!t done and make it happen. You’ll put our users first, and focus on improving our product and yourself every day. You’ll be able to straddle the need to work very fast and push stuff live, while maintaining a high standard and taking care of the details. You really must care, and this can’t just be ‘a job’ for you. And when work time is over, it’s party time!\n\nOur hiring process always starts with a fair, skills-based quiz on our platform, customised for the role. This will help us both understand your skills, ensure everyone is treated fairly and you’ll get a chance to see what you’ll be building. If you ace the quiz, you’re guaranteed an interview. No matter what happens, you’ll see your score at the end of the quiz.\n\nWe are, genuinely, an equal opportunity employer. We also don’t care about things that traditionally appear on job ads like ‘years of experience’, university qualifications etc.\n\nThe Role\n\nWe currently have a small team of remote developers, however we’re looking to set up our core development office in Sydney at Fishburners. We’re looking for a set of strong senior software engineers to help bring our product to the next level, with a major overhaul of the system architecture, using a service oriented approach and expanding our feature set.\n\nYou should have experience building well structured systems and are keen to work in the fast paced startup environment with a drive to do whatever it takes to make it happen. As we are still a small company, you will have a direct impact on the success of the business. You will be the driving force behind the implementation of the features and functionalities you’ll be working on.\n\nYou will work directly with the CTO, founder and a small team of developers to build out our assessment platform to be an enterprise grade web application to serve our small but growing user-base spread across the world.\n\nOur application is built with PHP (Laravel/Lumen), PostgreSQL, and React.js and is running on AWS. We are looking for capable people that can help expand our product and build it to scale with our users.
