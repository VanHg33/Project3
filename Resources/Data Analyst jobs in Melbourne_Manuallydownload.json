Your day to day involves feature engineering & scaling our model across multiple verticals and internationally.\n\nWe're using TimeSeries, Media Mix Modelling (MMM) and Bayesian techniques - you're not going to be building dashboards and running reports here.\n\nMutinex is a growing SaaS Startup that has found strong product Market fit, helping Marketers make better decisions.\n\nWe've grown from 20 to nearly 50 people over the past 12 months with hybrid working in Sydney or Melbourne.\n\nThe role\n\nThe key and core to the role is your ability to scale up state of the art modelling stacks, working at the cutting edge of delivering rapid model refreshes, workflows and world-class domains.\n\nYour day to day will consist of:\n• Build & deploy a state of the art model to solve key customer business challenges with complex Bayesian simulations\n• Use high quality Feature Engineering and EDA skillsets, with a nose for understanding the fundamental pattern of data, to service high quality signal rapidly\n• Drive continuous improvement of our MMM workflow and modelling process\n• Work with some of the most interesting, diverse datasets across a huge range of real-world datasets.\n\nWhat will the first 30-90 days look like\n\nStart by settling into your new company, team and role and learn how our model works, who our customers are, and our ways of working. You will quickly ramp up by jumping into forward-deployed workstreams, applying our model on real world data and upskilling on our state of the art methods through practice.\n\nAfter about 30 days you will be able to own multiple applications of the model autonomously.\n\nAfter 60 days you will be able to run customers model onboardings end-to-end, from feature engineering to model calibration.\n\nFrom 90 days on you will be contributing workflow improvements and driving automation of onboardings for new industries.\n\nHow success will be measured in this role:\n• Model refresh speed and how you’re able to scale your refresh capacity\n• Ability to create high quality signals for feature engineering\n• Ability to problem solve to ensure a strong, causal model foundations\n• Your ability to challenge the team to deliver causal inference within domains and push the team to really deeply understand new domains\n\nWhat we are looking for:\n\nWe are looking for Mid level Data Scientists with:\n• At least 1 year of experience in Data Science roles with either Time series, Bayesian or Media Mixed Modelling (MMM) experience. If you have all 3 then we're very keen to chat!\n• Bachelors Degree or higher in Stats/Maths and/or Computer Science\n• People who don’t believe frequentist techniques are achievable in the real-world\n\nCommercial experience with the following technologies:\n• Hands on coding in Python (Pandas, Numpy and open-source modelling libraries such as Scikit-Learn, XGBoost or Statsmodels) exploring and manipulating data, engineering new features and building and optimising model workflows to solve business problems;\n• SQL to extract and explore data from a data warehouse;\n• Comfortable with git\n• Dagster/Airflow experience is a bonus.\n\nAbout Mutinex\n\nWe might be an early stage startup but we already have strong product market fit, household name clients (Samsung, Mars, CUB and ING to name a few) and millions in revenue.\n\nBeing early stage means we're also still pretty scrappy and you wouldn't be coming into a well oiled machine, yet. But you would get a lot of opportunity to design, build and oil the machine until it's super oily.\n\nWe aren't aiming to be another Tech Unicorn because Unicorns aren't real. We are aiming (and confident of being) more like a real and really big animal that lives for a long time, like a Bowhead Whale.\n\nEquity is on offer on top of base salary and super with amazing growth potential and more benefits to come as we build out our offering.\n\nMutinex is a startup B2B SaaS platform that provides in-depth data analytics for marketers to better understand their ROI and make better decisions with future spend.\n\nFounded in Australia and with recent seed capital ($5 million, backed by EVP) we are growing our team to continue to improve our product, bring in new customers and enable them to make better and more informed decisions.\n\nWe have a hybrid work environment with no set or minimum days in the office and with teams in Sydney, Melbourne and expanding into the US.\n\nWith a team of around 45 people we value high quality communication, strong opinions that are held loosely and people who can give and take feedback well.",
