We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work.\n\nThat means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.\nWhat you'd be doing in this role\nAs Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun.\n\nSo this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.\nCanva is growing fast and hundreds of changes are made to our product every month.\n\nBut, with 135M+ active users, even small changes can have massive impact and we want to ensure all our users have a delightful experience alongside all that change.\n\nAs part of our team, you will contribute to solving this by helping to monitor critical user experience and business metrics, automate the detection of anomalies, and make it easier to identify root causes.\nThe end game is to detect and solve problems as fast as possible for all our users\nAbout the team\nThe Product Analytics team collects over 15B user interactions per day from our 135M+ MAU.\n\nThis rich dataset is used by hundreds of data specialists across the business to derive insights into our product and how it is received by our users.\n\nThe team is expanding its scope beyond collection and into action by providing our staff with real time metrics about the user experience which can be monitored when our product changes.\nThis is where you come in\n\nAt the moment, this role is focused on:\nWork in close collaboration with our engineers to automate recommendations based on time series data e.g. anomaly detection or causal and correlation modelling.\n\nFind insights that help us understand both Canva and our customers - we want you to be creative and insightful, rather than just throwing the usual metrics at the wall to see what sticks.\n\nSuggest and run interesting experiments that will actually move our metrics - when we push tests to 100% we want to actually see the bump in the relevant graph.\nOwn projects, data models, dashboards, and other artefacts and keep them up-to-date and high quality in a hypergrowth environment.\n\nUse our giant databases to answer the sort of questions that sound really simple but turn out to be challenging (and fun).\nHelp us extend data literacy and curiosity throughout the whole company.\n\nYou're probably a match if\n\nYou have strong competency with SQL; experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus\nYou are experienced with data wrangling and analysing data using Python.\n\nYou are experienced with time series analysis including how to perform anomaly detection, causal and correlation modeling to identify root causes.\nYou can demonstrate skillsacross optimising product funnels, running experiments, and building dashboards that effectively communicate results and outcomes.\nYou may have a grounding in mathematics/statistics and a bachelor's degree in a STEM area (not mandatory).\nYou may have played with very large data sets (not mandatory).\n\nYou are a strong communicator, verbally and written, with the ability able to break down complex topics into simple solutions and ideas.\n#LI-JC1\nWhat's in it for you?\n\nAchieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too.\nWe also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.\n\nHere's a taste of what's on offer:\n• Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too\n• Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers\n• An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more\n• Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally\nCheck out for more info.\nOther stuff to know\n\nWe make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture.\n\nWhen you apply, please tell us the pronouns you use and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process.\nPlease note that interviews are conducted virtually.\n\n#J-18808-Ljbffr",

Blunomy is growing the team to support the energy industry through its digitisation, decentralisation and decarbonisation transition and to support operability and planning in Australia and around the world.\n\nWe are looking for someone passionate about energy and data analytics to do-well-and-do-good by delivering data science products to better the energy market. As an analyst, you will work on projects under the supervision of project managers. In this setting, you will be exposed to the diversity of current energy challenges, leveraging your data and analytical skills to address them.\n\nExample projects\n\nWe are always growing the products we deliver but over the last 12 months we have delivered:\n\nLoad forecasting: model and predict the evolution of the load on the electrical network. Use machine learning, data analytics and a fair amount of software development to forecast long-term energy consumption, daily energy profiles and Distributed Energy Resources (Electric Vehicles, Battery, Solar PV).\nPV connections approval tool: dynamically model the energy network bringing together power flow modelling and machine learning to determine the PV hosting capacity of the local area. Used in production to approve hundreds of PV connection requests a day.\nVegetation management using LiDAR: collect three‑dimensional images of the local network gathered by drone or helicopter. Use machine learning and geometric models to detect and manage vegetation near powerlines.\nBushfire risk modelling: model and compute the network‑related bushfire risk based on fault ignition likelihood. Calculate the consequences of bushfires such as property damage or agricultural loss.\nLow-Voltage network mapping: identify errors within the current mapping of the low-voltage network, especially targeting customers whom connection to the network has not been properly recorded. This was performed using outlier detection with out-of-bag predictors.\n\nDepending on the objectives, projects will entail tasks of varying nature. Your first focus will be on projects requiring data analytics capabilities.\n\nWhy work for Blunomy?\n\nYou will be joining a passionate group of professionals, aligned in our mission to move towards a decarbonised, circular and inclusive economy. As we are currently in a stage of significant growth, you will be much more than a ‘cog in the machine’, with the ability to make a real and lasting impact across the business. We are focused on finding the right people to journey with us, and to those who do, we offer:\n\nAttractive salary packages\nAbility to participate in the company bonus scheme\nHybrid working environment, based in either Melbourne or Sydney\nAbility to be part of a global team\nOngoing learning and development opportunities\nWeekly team lunch/breakfast\nAccess to our health and wellbeing platform, Moka Care",

You don't need to be a machine learning expert, but you should understand this space quite well.\nAct as the Supergroup 'SWAT' team, ready to jump into the biggest problems that nobody else has the capacity for\nAdvise senior business stakeholders in the Growth Supergroup, Finance, and Strategy & Analysis in regards to major trends or insights\n\nRequired Skills & Experience\n\nStrong competency with SQL; experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus\n\nStrong communication skills - verbal and written - be able to break down complex topics into simple solutions and ideas.\nStakeholder management skills arevitalin this role.\nExperience wrangling and analysing data using Python or R\n\nPreferred (but not required) Skills & Experience\n\nExperience working with subscription-based data sets.
