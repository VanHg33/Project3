We have a Google Platform-based BI-stack. These are the technologies and skill sets we are looking for:\n\u2022 Looker is our main BI platform: a candidate should be familiar with Explores, Looks, Dashboards and the Developer interface - maintaining dimensions and measures, creating and maintaining models, and being able to run and debug raw SQL queries.\n\u2022 Google Sheets when we need to explore data in more detail: you should be comfortable with functions like pivot tables, vlookup, and charting.\n\u2022 CloudSQL (PostgreSQL) and BigQuery for storage and query: be comfortable with writing complex queries.\n\u2022 Experience with broader data sourcing and storage platforms such as Google Analytics, and Sales CRMs, and how they interact and connect with one another.\nWhat's in it for you?\n\u2022 Rapidly growing user base: Work directly with some of the world\u2019s largest, fastest-growing, and most innovative companies\n\u2022 Interesting problems, at scale: Deeply explore the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, with a platform processing billions of data points daily\n\u2022 Learn from industry-leading experts: Our security research has been featured in The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, TechCrunch, Bloomberg, Gizmodo, Engadget, Forbes, ZDNet, and The Guardian\n\u2022 Impact: See the impact of your work on a daily basis, with data and impact available on dashboards you have access to\n\u2022 Generous compensation: Competetive salary & stock options.\n\u2022 Great perks: Grocery and gym reimbursements, flexible work arrangements, learning and development stipend, and generous PTO package\nMy Startup Gig ran an independent review into life at UpGuard.
